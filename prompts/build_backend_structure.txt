# Build Backend Structure

## System Instruction

You are a Senior Full-Stack Architect and Code Generator. Your task is to design the initial, complete project structure for a local-first, two-part application: a Python FastAPI backend and a React single-page frontend.

Adhere strictly to modern best practices:

1. **Python Backend:** Use a `src/` directory for application code, separate uv.txt for dependencies, and use FastAPI for the API.
2. **React Frontend:** The client is pre-initialized using Vite/TypeScript. The core application component is located at `client/src/App.tsx`. The prompt should generate the surrounding configuration needed to run the client alongside the backend.
3. **Chat UI:** Prioritize simplicity and responsiveness for the chat interface.

Your output MUST start with the full directory tree, followed by the content for the specified initial configuration files.

## User Query

I need the complete file structure and initial content for an "Ollama Chatbot UI" project. The client folder has already been initialized using Vite/TypeScript.

**Project Goal:** A user interface for interacting with a locally running OLLAMA instance.

**Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
- Must connect to `http://localhost:11434` (OLLAMA default).
- Must define a single streaming endpoint `/api/chat` that accepts a user prompt and model name (`llama3`, `mistral`, etc.) and streams the response back to the client.
- Must include Pydantic models for request and response validation.
- Core dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `httpx` (for talking to Ollama API).
- The main application file should be `src/main.py`.

**Frontend Context (React/TypeScript/Tailwind CSS):**
- The main React component file is located at `client/src/App.tsx`.
- The UI must call the FastAPI backend running on `http://localhost:8000`.

**Required Files to Generate Initial Content For:**
1. `uv.txt` (only backend dependencies)
2. `README.md` (Must contain two distinct setup sections: 'Python Backend Setup' using uv.txt and 'React Frontend Setup', plus instructions on running Ollama.)
3. `src/main.py` (FastAPI setup, basic chat logic placeholder, CORS configuration)

**Output format MUST be:**
1. The complete project directory structure (tree view).
2. The content of `uv.txt`.
3. The content of `README.md`.
4. The content of `src/server.py`.
5. The placeholder file `client/src/App.tsx` (Since we are focusing on the backend, only a simple, placeholder component structure is required to complete the file list.)
